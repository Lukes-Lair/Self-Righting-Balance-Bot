# Self-Righting-Balance-Bot
This Hack Pack Hack allows the Balance Bot to stand up when it falls down. Normally the only weakness of this bot is that it will fall down after a while. Now, that weakness is gone!

2 Dc motors(I got mine off the domino robot)
1 Motor Driver/ H-Bridge(I also got this off the domino robot)
2 3D printed arms
Some Duct tape
# Instructions
1. Unplug the ultrasonic sensor wires
2. Plug the H-Bridge wires in as follows; PWMA:D10 AIN2:D4 AIN1:D2 STBY:A0 BIN1:12 BIN2:A1 PWMB:9
3. Make sure to plug in the vcc and gnd for the H-Bridge
4. Use duct tape to tape the DC motors on both sides as shown in the picure below
5. Put the 3D arms into the motors
6. Upload the code
7. Have Fun!
